# DC-Bird-Dashboard
This code pulls from the following dataset:
https://data.world/codefordc/ebird-data-for-washington-dc-2010-2015

The dataset includes information on different species of birds observed in DC, as well as the latitude
and longitude of where they were observed. The python code I created shows this data in an interactive map. 

As you zoom in you can see the clusters of the highest observations. Clicking
on each cluster will show each individual observation found in that area. Hovering
over a specific observation will show you the species.

Excited to see share and see what others do with this project.
